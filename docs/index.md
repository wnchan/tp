**StudentConnect is a solution for hassle-free team formation for students to browse profiles and connect with others for the CS2103T and CS2101 group project.**<br> 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using StudentConnect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-f12-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
