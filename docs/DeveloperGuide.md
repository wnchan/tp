### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the app.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initialises the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete johnd@u.nus.edu`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the 
`LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface 
rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of different parts e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter`, `ConfirmationPopup` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which 
captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are 
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is 
specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Group` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete johnd@u.nus.edu")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete johnd@u.nus.edu` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates 
a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse 
the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface 
so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)
<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; margin: auto;">
  <img src="images/PersonModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" alt="Person Model Class Diagram" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"/>
  <div>Person Model Class Diagram</div>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <img src="images/GroupModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" alt="Group Model Class Diagram" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"/>
  <div>Group Model Class Diagram</div>
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), and all 
`Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which 
is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g., the UI can be bound to 
this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which 
is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Group>` that can be 'observed' e.g., the UI can be bound to this 
list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, 
they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramNew.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

---

### Tutorial Field

#### Current Implementation

In response to the evolving needs of StudentConnect, we have introduced several essential enhancements to user profiles. These enhancements include the addition of fields for Tutorial, Nationality, and Gender.

The Tutorial field is a crucial addition to the StudentConnect application, providing users with the capability to specify their tutorial groups, which are integral to their group formation needs. Here, we detail how the Tutorial field is implemented:

- **Data Structure**: Tutorials are now stored as a Set of Tutorial objects within the Person model. The use of a Set ensures that no duplicate tutorials can be associated with a single user. The code snippet below demonstrates this implementation:

  ```java
  Set<Tutorial> tutorials = new HashSet<Tutorial>();
  ```

- **Tutorial Attributes**: Each Tutorial object possesses an attribute called "value," which is of type string. The "value" must adhere to a two-digit format, ranging from 01 to 22.


- **Consistency**: The decision to enforce a two-digit format (e.g., T01, T02) was made for consistency, ensuring that all tutorials are consistently represented as "TXX," where XX corresponds to the tutorial group.


- **Range**: The allowed range of values, spanning from 01 to 22, aligns with the number of available tutorial group options for AY2023/2024 SEM1.


- **Set vs. List**: Initially, the tutorials field was implemented as a List of Tutorial objects (`List<Tutorial>`). However, we observed that this approach allowed for multiple duplicate tutorials to be input without triggering errors. To address this, we transitioned to using a Set of tutorials, which inherently disallows duplicate entries without the need for additional validation checks:

  ```java
  // Initial implementation as a List
  List<Tutorial> tutorials = new ArrayList<Tutorial>();
  ```

---

### List Tasks Feature

#### Current Implementation

The list tasks feature is facilitated by the `TasksCommand` class and involves the cooperation of several other classes including `Group`, `TaskList`, and `Model`. This command is designed to list all tasks associated with a specific group in StudentConnect, which is particularly useful for managing tasks in courses like CS2103T and CS2101.

The process is initiated when the user inputs a command to list tasks associated with a group. Here's the breakdown of the steps and class interactions:

1. **Input Parsing**: The user's input is first parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which identifies the command word and delegates the argument parsing to `TasksCommandParser`.

2. **Command Creation**: `TasksCommandParser` parses the provided arguments, checks for correctness, and if valid, constructs a `TasksCommand` object with the specified group number.

3. **Command Execution**: `TasksCommand#execute()` is then called. It retrieves the specified group by number using `Model#getGroupWithNumber()`. If the group exists, it then retrieves the group's tasks using `Group#getTasks()`.

4. **Task Initialisation**: If no tasks are currently set, `TasksCommand` initialises a default set of tasks through `TaskInitializer.initializeTasks()` to ensure that each group has tasks pre-set, reflecting the course's structure.

5. **Result Generation**: Finally, the tasks are converted to a String format and included in the `CommandResult` which then displays the tasks in the feedback panel.

The `TasksCommand` class performs the following operations:
- `TasksCommand#execute()` - Lists all tasks for the specified group number.
- `TasksCommand#equals()` - Compares this `TasksCommand` with another command for equality, based on the group number.

The feature's utility is highlighted by its ability to list pre-set tasks automatically assigned to each group, reflecting the tasks specific to CS2103T and CS2101 courses.

#### Proposed Future Implementation

The future enhancements for the Tasks Command aim to significantly improve user interaction and task management within the application. The proposed improvements will enable users to not only list tasks but also add, edit, and delete tasks as per their requirements. This will provide users with full control over how they manage the task workflow for each group, making the application more flexible and user-friendly.

Additionally, we plan to develop a dedicated panel within the User Interface (UI) specifically for tasks. This dedicated task panel will allow users to view all tasks in a separate, focused area of the UI, making task management more organized and less cluttered. With a dedicated panel, the tasks will not only be more visible but can also be interacted with in a more intuitive way. Users will be able to see at a glance all the tasks for a group, check their completion status, and access task details with a single click.

---

###  Create group feature

#### Implementation

The create group feature is implemented via the `CreateCommand` class and involves the following classes: `Group`, `UniqueGroupList`, `JsonAdaptedGroup`, `AddressBook`, `JsonSerializableAddressBook`.
<br>
`CreateCommand` implements the following operations:
* `CreateCommand#execute()` — Creates a new empty group using the group number generated from `generateGroupNumber`.
* `CreateCommand#generateGroupNumber()` — Generates the next available group number.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in "create t/01". The string, "t/01", is parsed by `CreateCommandParser`, which returns a new instance of `CreateCommand`.
<br>
Step 2. The command is then executed by `CreateCommand#execute()`. `CreateCommand#execute()` calls `CreateCommand#generateGroupNumber()`.
<br>
Step 3. `CreateCommand#generateGroupNumber()` generates the next available group number, which is the next largest number that has not been assigned to a group. It loads in the current state of the Address Book via `AddressBook#getAddressBook`. It then iterates over the `Group` list inside the Address Book and checks the numbers of the groups to determine the next available group number.
<br>
Step 4. `CreateCommand#execute()` creates a new `Group` using the generated group number and adds it to the Address Book via `AddressBook#addGroup`.
<br>
Step 5. The `CommandResult` containing the success message is shown to the user.

Shown below is the sequence diagram for the given scenario. The `LogicManager`, `AddressBookParser` and `Model` classes are also included to give a complete picture of the process.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* CS2103T student
* Face challenges in finding like-minded students for group projects
* Busy academic schedule
* Need assistance in keeping track of project deadlines, tasks, and progress
* Can type fast
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions

**Value proposition**: StudentConnect stores and organises students’ contact details, and project group.
Students can easily search for the profiles of other students and connect with potential teammates.
This streamlines the process of forming project teams. It also offers tools for tracking project
progress/deadlines, ensuring that the group stays on task. There is no other application quite like StudentConnect for
CS2103T students.
