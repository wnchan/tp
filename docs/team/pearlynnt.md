### Project: StudentConnect

StudentConnect is a desktop application that stores and organises students’ contact details, and project group. Students can easily search for the profiles of other students and connect with potential teammates. This streamlines the process of forming project teams. It also offers tools for tracking project progress/deadlines, ensuring that the group stays on task.
